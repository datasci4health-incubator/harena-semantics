## Overview

ASM indexes a papers collection to enable efficient search over it.

Papers collection is from http://www.trec-cds.org/2014.html. 

The collection is automatically downloaded through the installation process (`docker-compose` command)

## Getting Started

### Running as Docker containers

At the ```harena-asm/``` root folder run the command to start the docker container:

```docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up```

As the start process is done, you must access the following endpoint in order to index the papers:  

```buildoutcfg
GET http://localhost:5000/indexer
```

 you can get access to the container through the sh:

```bash
docker exec -it harena-asm sh
```

You can access ASM at http://localhost:5000
You can access SOLR admin at http://localhost:8983

## Performing Searches

```buildoutcfg
POST http://localhost:5000/searcher

params: description (text)
```
