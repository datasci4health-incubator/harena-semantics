Acute myocardial infarction is usually manifested by anginal chest pain (tightening), lasting more than 20 minutes, and may radiate from the mandibular area to the umbilicus. For its diagnosis, it is necessary, in addition to the clinical history, to have changes in the markers of myocardial injury, and to observe the pattern of the electrocardiogram. Acute myocardial infarction can be, depending on the pattern visualized on the electrocardiogram, with ST-segment elevation or without ST-segment elevation. Faced with an ST elevation and AMI clinic, revascularization begins
It is when the cardiac muscle suffers ischemia, it can be derived from a thrombus in the coronary arteries (among other situations.). It is defined as AMI when you have symptoms of ischemia and ascending descent of myocardial necrosis markers. May or may not have ECG changes
Acute infarction can have an ECG representation with or without SupraST and can occur due to complete or incomplete occlusion of a coronary artery. It is an acute coronary syndrome, clinically represented by angina-type chest pain, feeling of heaviness or tightness, which may or may not radiate to the neck, back or arms, lasting more than 20 minutes and which does not relieve with rest. It may be accompanied by other signs and symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, muscle weakness or even just epigastric pain (women, elderly) It implies damage to the heart muscle, with elevation of myocardial injury markers. However, in cases of ADE with Supra, one cannot wait for the results of the markers and should immediately proceed to an angioplasty in order to unclog the artery
There are different types of infarctions, the infarctions covered in the classes referred to type 1 infarctions, in which there is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. within infarts, there are infarcts with SupraST and without SuprasT. Infarcts with supraST are an emergency and require immediate intervention with PCI or fibrinolysis (depending on whether the time to PCI is longer than 2h). All infarcts require first intervention with Enoxaparin, Aspirin and Ticagrelor. In the case of ICP, double anti-aggregation is performed.
Typical presentation: acute thoracic, more frequently retrosternal and may radiate to the neck, shoulders, upper limbs. Atypical presentations: epigastric pain, nausea, dyspnea Epidemiology: more frequent in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors: age, male gender, hypertension, dyslipidemia, Diabetes Mellitus, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, bad habits and lifestylesECG: can be divided into MAS with ST elevation and without ST elevation, with ST elevation suggesting total occlusion of the affected artery. Elevation of troponins. Changes in segmental kinetics on echocardiography. Symptomatic treatment (morphine), anti-ischemic. Revascularization technique for cataterism, surgery or fibrinolysis may be necessary. pathophysiology: atherosclerosis with coronary artery stenosis
EAM is a pathology associated with myocardial tissue ischemia. This ischemia is caused by obstruction of one or more coronary arteries. The extension of the adjacent lesion (necrosis) itself is correlated with the time it takes to act, as well as with the degree of obstruction of the artery. These injuries are often irreversible. If there is complete occlusion and consequent myocardial necrosis and infeasibility, an ECG will show SupraST. Otherwise, InfraST may be present. The appearance of these ST alterations in the leads are congruent with the artery that was affected. These myocardial lesions can, in turn, lead to alterations in the segmental kinetics itself, with the appearance of ventricular dysfunction and the respective congestive consequences that ensue.
Epidemiologically, it is more common in males and over 65 years of age. It presents with a very intense, retrosternal squeezing pain that may radiate to the left upper limb, neck or epigastrium. In addition, it may be accompanied by dyspnea and inability to make small efforts. On ECG, it presents with elevation of ST-segment elevation in the leads corresponding to the affected areas and increase in cardiac markers.
It manifests as sudden onset chest pain, usually at rest, which worsens over time. May radiate to arms, jaw, epigastrium. It may have associated dyspnea, dizziness, loss of awareness, palpitations. Analytically, there is an increase in myocardial necrosis markers. It can be with or without ST elevation on the electrocardiogram, which corresponds to a complete or incomplete occlusion of the artery, respectively.
Epidemiology: disease that affects men earlier than women, increasing its risk with advancing age; its risk factors are smoking, lack of physical activity, alcoholism, among others.Clinical presentation: sudden onset pain and anterior thoracic location, usually retrosternal or precordial, with possible irradiation to the shoulders, left arm, and to the back; it can also be an epigastric pain. to the sick
EAM is a pathology in which there is myocardial ischemia, which can occur for several reasons, including rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombus formation and occlusion of a coronary artery, due to imbalances between the needs and perfusion of the myocardium (vasospasm, anemia, coronary dissection, etc.), may be associated with sudden death or occur in a revascularization procedure such as PCI or CABG. It may be associated with an elevation of the seg,ento st in the ecg in the contiguous leads corresponding to the territory in ischemia or present without a st elevation, it may present inversions of the T wave, infras of ts in reciprocal derivations and the appearance of q waves indicative of scarring. Acute elevation of myocardial necrosis markers may be associated with malignant arrhythmia, namely in the first 3 days after the event, it may lead to rupture and ventricular wall or septum and
Acute myocardial infarction is a clinical condition secondary to ischemia and myocardial injury. The underlying causes of this condition can be multiple, such as obstruction of a coronary artery by thrombus, rupture of atherosclerotic plaque, by angina or vasospasm, by the increase in oxygen requirements with inability to support this need, by artery dissection, among others. The most characteristic symptoms are tightening retrosternal pain, radiating or to the arms, jaw, or even to the navel, dyspnoea, vomiting, palpitations, anxiety. For diagnosis it is essential to perform an ECG, to see if there is supra
It consists of an area of myocardial muscle ischemia due to occlusion of a coronary artery. The diagnosis is made using an ECG, showing a supraST. Treatment must be immediate, using catheterization with application of a coronary stent in order to unblock the occluded artery. In the long term, take aspirin together with prasugrel for 1 year after catheterization, as well as start statin, ACE inhibitors, healthy lifestyle measures, smoking cessation.
It usually has an acute presentation (few hours of evolution), is characterized as pain in retrosternal tightening, possibly radiating to the mandible or left upper limb (most commonly), which is aggravated by exertion and which is relieved with rest/nitrates. They may be accompanied by general symptoms such as paleness, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting and even syncope. On physical examination, alterations may not be detected, but they will be characterized by an increase in myocardial necrosis markers (myoglobin, troponin I, CK) in the plasma and electrocardiographic alterations, which may appear supra-ST. The therapy will be anti-aggregant and anticoagulant, or will undergo revascularization. Patients are commonly accompanied by CV risk factors. In echocardgioragam, some hypokinesis of cardiac walls may be seen, resulting from ische
Myocardial injury/necrosis disease, with clinical evidence of ischemia, such as acute, retrosternal, oppressive chest pain, aggravated by exertion, relieved by rest or nitrates, and may radiate to the left and/or right upper limb, neck, jaw and epigastrium, often associated with symptoms such as hypersweating, nausea and/or vomiting, agitation, confusion, feeling of death and palpitations. Associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as: smoking, overweight/obesity, sedentary lifestyle, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia. It is a clinical situation that requires a diagnosis and emergent therapy, with an ECG performed within 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms and anti-ischemic therapy with ASA and pain relief with nitrates. After the ECG, if there is evidence of ST elevation, revascularization is requested and if without elevation
EAM is a pathology that has its origins in a greater or lesser degree of ischemia of the arteries that supply the coronary tissue. This ischemia can have several origins, which in turn gives rise to several types of EAM. The most common ADEs (type 1 and 2) are caused by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque or an unmet need for oxygen

AMI, acute event, oppressive retrosternal pain, with ECG changes with ST-up or ST-up. Changes in blood count with increased markers of myocardial necrosis. There are 5 types of EAM.
Possible symptoms: angina pectoris (oppressive retrosternal pain lasting more than 20 min, which relieves with rest or nitrates and worsens with exertion), dyspnoea, syncope. In the elderly, diabetics, and women may not be typical.FR: Dyslipidemia , age, diabetes, high uremia, hypertension. If EAM is suspected, perform ECG and cardiac markers immediately. Pay attention to other differential diagnoses (TEP, aortic dissection, esophageal rupture) After infarction, there must be double aggregation (eg, aspirin + ticagrelor). Controlling FRCV is very important.
Myocardial tissue ischemia requiring urgent intervention
Acute myocardial infarction is a cardiac condition that results from damage to cardiac tissue due to ischemic causes. Acute myocardial infarctions can be due to a total or partial obstruction of one or more coronary vessels. At the acute level, if it is a total obstruction, it presents as an supra ST in adjacent ECG leads, if it is a partial obstruction, it presents without as an infra-ST. Subsequently, the ECG presentation changes due to chronic myocardial changes. Its main risk factors are dyslipidemia, smoking and alcohol consumption. It is one of the most frequent causes of death in Portugal, a cause of chest pain that should always be investigated in the initial approach to a patient with this complaint.
The AMI can be with ST-up or ST-up, with an increase in the level of troponins above the 99th percentile of normality, it is also an acute myocardial injury that incorporates symptoms that can be: chest pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, anxiety, sweating (...), ECG changes, Q waves again, evidence of ischemia, and evidence of coronary thrombus. Diagnosis involves a clinical history, physical examination, complete means of diagnosis (blood count, biochemistry, ECG, ecoTT...). The treatment involves changes in the patients' lifestyle, aspirin and dual anti-platelet aggregation for 1 year, plus statins, ACE inhibitors or B blockers when necessary...
Intense retrosternal anginal pain, possibly radiating to the left arm, neck and jaw. It is a pain that does not alleviate with rest. It is usually preceded by typical anginal pain that can progress from stable to unstable. In the hospital approach of the patient, it is mandatory to perform an ECG on entry in less than 10 minutes in order to distinguish between Supra-St and without Supra-st. The patient must also be analyzed to obtain myocardial necrosis markers, the troponins. Revascularization should be performed as soon as possible, at the patient's risk. As a therapeutic, anti-ischemic and anti-thrombotic.
Acute Myocardial Infarction can be characterized as having Supra-ST or not having Supra-ST. As for the MAS with Supra-ST, it is a complete occlusion of the artery and, given the presence of Supra-ST on the ECG, we immediately proceeded to catheterization. When to EAM without Supra-ST. it is a subocclusion of the artery and whether there is infra-ST or no changes in the ECG. we ask for the cardiac markers to confirm the dx and guide the tx.
Acute myocardial infarction is a medical emergency, so we must be aware of symptoms that might make you suspect it. Tight chest pain, radiating between the mandible and the umbilicus, lasting longer than 30 minutes is a strong indicator of ADE. The priority complementary exam in case of suspected EAM is the ECG and must be performed within the first 10 minutes after the patient enters the ER. MAEs can be divided into supra-ST and without supra-T, and when an infarct with supra-ST is detected, the border must be done quickly. When we are in the presence of an EAM with supramaintenance, the patient must be evaluated for reperfusion and do it within a maximum of 120 minutes since entering the ER. The treatment of AMI with supra and without supra is identical and consists of the administration of aspirin, ticagrelor/prasugrel/clopidogrel, BB,
It is an acute event of myocardial injury, with elevation of troponins and the presence of symptoms of myocardial necrosis, such as chest pain, retrosternal. It can be accompanied by ECG changes, the most common being elevation in contiguous ST-segment leads. It is also characterized by fluctuation in myocardial necrosis markers (with troponin being the most commonly used), with a reduction within a few hours of the event (unlike other chronic situations of cardiac damage).
EAM is a pathology that courses with the total occlusion of a coronary artery, in this case type 1, and in which it may or may not present an ST elevation on the ECG and, in analytical terms, it courses with an increase in myocardial necrosis markers, myoglobin troponins and ck-mb. The symptoms include pain in retrosternal tightening, radiating to limbs, neck or epigastrium, which does not alleviate with rest and is of viable intensity. however, presentations vary with the patient's biotype.
AMI results from an occlusion of a coronary artery or decreased blood flow. Retrosternal, abdominal, or radiating chest pain to the jaw, arm, or back. Urgency - performance of ECG and troponins. EAM with or without above. T
Acute myocardial infarction occurs when there is a complete obstruction of a coronary artery leading to necrosis of the myocardial wall that this artery supplies. The patient has very severe pain with minutes of wrapping and sweating. ST-elevation ECG and increased myocardial necrosis markers. The tx is with anticoagulants, antiplatelet, ACE inhibitors, Morphine, Cathetarism, Beta block
Arterial occlusion of the coronary circulation, with myocardial necrosis and consequent elevation of markers. It can be total/transmural where it manifests with supraST on the ECG or partial occlusion. Additionally, it is accompanied by acute symptoms (chest pain, syncope, nausea,...)
Acute myocardial infarction is a pathology of the cardiovascular system. It is usually associated with ischemia of the cardiac muscle - either due to thromboembolism or a dysregulation of the O2 supply to the muscle. In the presence of increased necrosis markers we can make a diagnosis of infarction. The infarction may or may not be associated with an ECG elevation of the ST segment. In the treatment, it is important to treat the pain, but also to perform double anticoagulation
Acute myocardial infarction occurs when there is a decrease in oxygen supply to cardiac muscle cells that is less than their needs, which causes ischemia or even necrosis. This phenomenon is clinically manifested as an acute pain in the chest that can radiate to other areas of the body such as the upper limbs or the jaw, being a continuous pain that does not alleviate at rest. In terms of biochemistry, there is an increase in troponins and myoglobin. And on the electrocardiogram, changes can also be seen, such as ST-segment elevation in the case of an EAM with ST-segment elevation.
Acute myocardial infarction corresponds to necrosis of the cardiac tissue due to alterations in the O2 supply, it can be classified into classes, and the most common etiology is atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries. Its common clinical presentation is oppressive reroexternal pain that can radiate to the mandible, ipsilateral shoulder and arms (we have more manifestations), the pain usually lasts more than 20 min. The ECG may show alterations in the ST segment , namely supra ST , although there is EAM Without ST - supra and there is an increase in myocardial necrosis biomarkers
AMI corresponds to myocardial ischemia resulting from a total occlusion of a coronary artery. Typically, it presents with pain lasting about 30 min, retrosternal, tightening, of high intensity, which worsens with exertion. Typically accompanied by hypersweating and nausea. It often occurs in the early morning hours. It is an emergency, life-threatening, and therefore it is necessary to perform an ECG within 10 minutes to rule out or confirm this diagnosis. one should not wait for MNMs to refer the patient for urgent cardiac catheterization if diagnosed with MAS with suprast.
Acute myocardial infarction can be classified into several types (from type I to type v). This can also be classified according to the electrocardiographic changes in AMI with Supra ST or without Supra ST, which must be associated with the elevation of cardiac markers. Treatment varies depending on whether it is with or without Supra and associated with hemodynamic status
The EAM is characterized by any condition that causes the occlusion of the coronary artery (type 1), reduces myocardium oxygen supply (type 2) - most common. Additionally, as a clinical presentation, there is the oppressive pain that can radiate to the left upper limb, mandible and even to the epigastrium. In addition, sweating, nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, tachycardia are common. Normally relieves with nitrates and rest.
Acute myocardial infarction is differentiated from stable and unstable anginas. Stable angina has no increase in cardiac markers or ecg changes. Unstable angina has changes in the markers, but no ecg. EAM has marker and ECG changes. These ECG changes can be supra or infra ST. When we identify ST-segment alterations, we must refer the patient as soon as possible for reperfusion angiography. If we do not have access to a hemodynamics laboratory then we have to start pharmacological thrombectomy. It is important oxygen therapy, morphine
EAM is a cardiac lesion with signs and symptoms of ischemia; pathophysiologically it is characterized by stenosis of one or more arteries that make up the coronary skeleton, by different mechanisms, with atherosclerosis being the main one; there are several subtypes: I (associated with ischemia), II, III, IV...; clinically, they may present as intense pain, lasting more than 30 minutes, which is not relieved with rest or with the administration of nitrates, accompanied by other systemic symptoms; objectively, it can present on the ECG with elevation of the ST segment and J point in more than 2 contiguous leads, in a situation of total occlusion of the artery, therefore trasmural ischemia; or with repolarization changes on opposite walls; or with ST infras, when there is occlusion; there is also an elevation of biomarkers: namely Tpartial and hence subendocardial ischemia.
Acute myocardial infarction is an acute cardiac event that can happen due to several mechanisms. The most common is myocardial ischemia due to occlusion by an atherosclerotic plaque, however it can be caused by disturbances between the supplied oxygen and the needs, vasospasm or iatrogenic mechanisms as complications of invasive procedures, namely catheterization. if in people with a history of cardiovascular risk factors: arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, smoking. Clinically, depending on the affected wall, it can have a different clinical presentation: I emphasize the retrosternal chest pain in high intensity tightening, which appears in the morning (+++), however it can be an epigastric pain or no pain. Here I refer to the elderly, women and patients with diabetes
it is caused by an occlusion of a coronary artery. this occlusion can occur by thrombus, embolus, or by microvascular or vasospatic alterations. there are 5 types of MI, type 1 being the most frequent, typically caused by rupture of atherosclerotic plaques; type 2 refers to vasospastic or microvascular alterations; type 3 and type 4 are associated with surgical procedures for coronary revascularization and type 5 is the one whose diagnosis is only made in the post-mortem. the symptomatology is typically retrosternal squeezing pain, which can radiate to any location between the navel and the mandible, with a sudden onset. the diagnosis is made through the ecg, which allows us to distinguish between EAM with and without supra. in the face of an ema without supra, it is necessary to measure troponin I to distinguish between unstable angina and an ema without supra. revascularization treatment is preferred, being carried out until 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. the use of fibrinolytics is reduced to 3 hours after the onset of symptoms. tx of pain. and oxygen therapy if saturations below 90.
Acute Myocardial Infarction, can be with ST Supra or without ST Supra, which corresponds to an occlusion of a coronary artery, more than 95% (in the case of ST-supra or less than 95% (without ST-supra or infra- ST) In the ecg it corresponds to an elevation of the ST segment, in the leads corresponding to the affected wall. It may give symptoms such as chest pain, radiating to the arms, jaw or dorsal region. It may give symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating, syncope , and these representations are more atypical, in older patients or women. In the analyzes we have an increase in myocardial necrosis markers, such as troponins. In an EAM with Supra-ST, we must perform primary percutaneous intervention as soon as possible. Life long medication with aspirin ; control cardiovascular risk factors.
EAM - sudden, retrosternal pain that can radiate to the jaw or left arm or epigastrium, in tightness, which does not relieve with anything. It may have associated dyspnea. It is important to understand the CVRF - age, gender, tobacco, cholesterol, etc. ECG changes with supra (transmural infarction) or without ST (subendocardial infarction) Echocardiogram can verify changes in the segmental kinetics of the heart. Tx undergoes revascularization, ideally from the time of admission 10 min maximum until the ECG (infarction confirmation), then if ICP-P is not available in the next two hours, I must perform fibrinolysis. Tx passes by aspirin, ticagrelol and enoxaparin. If necessary o2 if saturation is less than 90%; morphine for pain if needed. Long-term must take aspirin for life, and ticagrelol for at least 6 months. Smoking and alcohol cessation and lifestyle modification are also required.
Typical symptomatology: retrosternal chest pain, of a tightening character, which may radiate to the jaw, shoulders, back, navel, or others; nausea, vomiting, malaise, fever and sweating may be present; Signs: Tachycardia may be present, as well as absence of palpable pulses, hypotension; Pathophysiology: results from complete occlusion of a coronary artery; possible risk factors are: dyslipidemia, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure. Treatment: aspirin + unfractionated ticagrelorheparin/long-term low molecular weight heparin: aspirin + ticagrelor (at least one year)beta-blockersstatinspironolactoneIECA
Acute event. Retrosternal pain, tightening, aggravated by efforts that relieve with rest and nitrates. It can range from the navel to the shoulder and jaw. ECG changes with or without ST elevation and signs of myocardial ischemia with elevated cardiac enzymes.
Typical presentation of chest pain at rest for more than 20 minutes, associated with sweating and nausea. However, the pain can be located from the mandibular region to the navel, or it can occur without any type of pain (DM, women, elderly). Physical examination may be normal. We have 10 minutes to perform the ECG. We should start aspirin and order cardiac necrosis markers. After confirming the ADE, start an anticoagulant and add ticogrelol. Perform catheterization if EAM with supra (complete artery occlusion), if EAM without elevation, there are criteria to decide whether to perform catheterization or not. There are several types of EAM (type 1 to 5).
The AMI can be without ST or with ST. The infarct without supra has a normal ECG or with infra ST and MNM (troponins) increased. In an infarction with ST elevation, ECG has an elevation of ST, although there is an elevation of troponins to start therapy, there is no need to wait for the result, immediately indicating an indication for cataterism. Both are treated with dual antiaggregation maintained for one year and with HBM maintained in the acute phase of the infarction.
AMI is myocardial necrosis that occurs due to lack of oxygen supply, due to occlusion of one or more coronary arteries. There are 5 types of ]48AMI: type 1 - coronary artery occlusion due to a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque, for example; type 2 - imbalance in the supply/need of O2; type 3 - death due to MI in the absence of MNM; type 4 - EAM that occurred due to PCI; type 5 - AMI that occurred due to coronary bypass surgery. Acute coronary syndrome can be subdivided into: AMI with ST-elevation or AMI without ST-elevation (elevation of myocardial necrosis markers) and unstable angina (less than 20 min pain, no MNM elevation and no ST elevation). MAS presents with retrosternal tightening pain that may radiate to the jaw, left arm, and abdomen; pain that occurs after exertion or stress. It can be associated with sweating, dyspnea... in women and the elderly, they may not and
Acute myocardial infarction occurs when a coronary artery is completely occluded for various reasons. It can be caused by a thrombus created in a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in a coronary artery, or by vasospasm, or a stenosis of a sufficient degree not to supply the heart with its necessary oxygen demands. It usually appears with tightening retrosternal chest pain, radiating between the umbilicus and the angle of the mandible. It usually appears in patients with cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking history, diabetes, hypercholesterolinemia. In the hospital context, it is sought after performing an ECG that may appear with supra st in 2 or more contiguous leads, and with elevation of myocardial necrosis factors. Urgent catheterization and triple antiaggregation and anticoagulant therapy logo.
It is an acute event usually associated with chest pain, which may or may not radiate to the arms, especially the left, to the neck and jaw, to the back or to the epigastrium. Pain may appear associated with dizziness, syncope, diaphoresis, malaise. Physiopathologically it corresponds to the occlusion of a coronary artery, due to atherosclerosis or embolism. of the ST segment. Additionally, the value of myocardial necrosis markers such as troponin, myoglobin and CK-MB should be evaluated.
Myocardial ischemia, to which CV risk factors contribute. AMI typically appears as acute retrosternal pain, radiating to the neck, jaw, and limbs. It can appear with dyspnea, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, Nausea, vomiting and diaphores are other symptoms. Acute retrosternal pain must be urgently addressed by performing an ECG in less than 10 min, which will reveal ischemic changes. Thus, we can differ in ACS with ST-elevation or without ST-elevation. ACS with ST-segment elevation requires emergent catheterization in less than 2 hours. ACS without ST-uplift can be delayed or catheterized for less than 24 hours. Acute TX includes aspirin, and clopidogrel, LMWH. Oxygen if saturation is less than 90. Nitrates or morphine for pain relief. Statin started as soon as possible. Beta blocker is a prognosis modifier and must be performed in patients with LVEF < 40. ACE inhibitors and
In the diagnostic approach of an AMI, it is important to initially classify it as an EMA with ST-segment elevation or without ST-segment elevation. As such, in a patient with sudden onset chest pain (stabbing, pressure), which does not subside with rest and lasts > 20 minutes, it is mandatory to perform an ECG that immediately indicates whether it is an ST elevation. It is not above to ask for myocardial necrosis markers (highly sensitive troponin) at admission and 1 hour later. In the presence of an increase in troponin with no ECG changes, we are faced with an AMI without supra. In any of the types, immediately aspirin and hypocoagualar with enoxaparin and then proceed to PCI in the case of supra or in the case of without supra as per the criterion

AMI can be with or without ST elevation on the ECG, which is the first exam to be performed. Next, it is important to know the result of the myocardial necrosis markers that should be elevated. It is characterized by retrosternal tightness pain with or without irradiation, without relief factors. It resolves with fibrinolysis or revascularization.
It's an Acute Coronary Syndrome. It is often characterized by retrosternal pain radiating from the arm to the jaw root. When the patient suffers from chest pain, an ECG should be performed in less than 10 minutes, and it should be noted whether he has ST elevation or not. If so, refer for urgent catheterization. If not, ask for cardiac markers like troponins. We must medicate the patient with dual antiaggregation: aspirin and ticagrelor and with an anticoagulant: it could be heparin. We must also provide nitrate for pain relief.

it results from a total or partial occlusion of a coronary artery. there are 5 types of infarction, 1 - due to rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, 2 - due to imbalance between oxygen demand/requirement, 3 - death, 4 - secondary to percutaneous revascularization, 5 - secondary to surgical revascularization by bypass. Serial ECG mandatory (there may be ST elevation that means total occlusion and these will soon go to chronic revascularization, or without ST elevation, which means partial occlusion), serial myocardial necrosis markers, echocardiogram. After a heart attack, it is necessary to perform anti-aggregation therapy and control of cardiovascular risk factors.
Myocardial necrosis as a consequence of ischemia for more than 20 min, resulting in sudden, stabbing, or squeezing chest pain, usually radiating to the left arm or mandible. It may be accompanied by sweating, malaise and vomiting. The diagnosis must be made by performing an ECG and measuring the lesion markers (CK, Troponin I and
Acute myocardial infarction is part of the acute coronary syndromes. There is an increase in myocardial necrosis markers (eg, troponins) and there may or may not be ECG changes, for example, supra ST. Treatment can be with morphine for pain relief, oxygen if necessary, nitrates and dual anti-aggregation for 2 years , s

AMI falls into the category of acute coronary syndromes. It can manifest in different ways, such as chest pain, palpitations, sweating, nausea, vomiting, and the most common presentation is tight chest pain, radiating to the mandibular or arms or neck. It is important in suspected AMI to perform an ECG in less than 10 minutes upon arrival at the hospital, which in addition to confirming the dx will allow us to differentiate an supra ST from an ingfra ST with tx implications. (5 minutes not enough. for everything we know about AMI)
Acute myocardial infarction is an ischemic pathology of the cardiac muscle that can be caused by ischemia (thrombus or obstruction of the vessel that supplies the muscle), deficient oxygenation of this muscle (hypoxia or hyperkinetic states); post-surgery; post-trauma or infectious cause. This is a total obstruction of the vessel that supplies the myocardium for more than 20 minutes and can lead to syncope, AF, ventricular tachycardias; and may result in hypokinesia of the schemic region or even necrosis of these cells. It should be treated with morphine, oxygenation, nitrates and aspirin + double hypoaggregation (aspirin and clopidogrel) + hypocoagulation (enoxaparin)
AMI typically presents as severe chest pain that may radiate to the upper limbs or jaw. It can also present with sweating, nausea and altered state of consciousness. It can occur in the morning, and it occurs more often in people with a history of dyslipidemia, diabetes, high blood pressure and overweight. It presents on admission as acute coronary syndrome and may occur with elevation of ts elevation in the ecg or without elevation. As a rule, there is an increase in cardiac injury markers. Depending on the presentation with or without supra, the treatment will differ, with an infarction with an supra
Acute myocardial infarction is part of the group of acute coronary syndromes and may present with ST segment elevation or ST segment depression. It usually presents with high intensity tightening chest pain that may start with exertion or at rest. It may also have associated manifestations of dyspnea, diaphoresis, among others. It usually presents with an increase in cardiac markers, such as myoglobin and troponin I, the latter being the most specific. The echocardiogram may present with akinesia or dyskinesia of the cardiac wall.
- Medical emergency.- Very important to perform ECG: supra ST makes the diagnosis. - Ask for cardiac markers but do not rule out our hypothesis of AMI if they are negative.- The time factor is very important: the more time that passes, the greater the necrosis of myocytes.- Importance of performing cardiac catheterization as soon as possible, if our hypothesis is confirmed.- Therapy with an anti-aggregant, anticoagulant, B blocker. MONA is in disuse, and the use of aspirin for the prevention of future events is just "universal".- In addition to revascularization surgery and pharmacological therapy, lifestyle changes are important (balanced diet, physical practice, smoking and alcohol cessation) the control of underlying pathologies (HTA, DM and dyslipidemia).
Risk factors: male gender, advanced age, history of AMI, family history; smoking, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, dyslipidemia. Etiology: there are 5 types of AMI- type 1: AMI results from the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with consequent formation of thrombus. - type 2 AMI: imbalance between the supply and need for oxygen by the cardiopulmonary artery; - type 3 AMI: cardiac death before dx, which is done at autopsy; -AMI type 4: within 48h after PCI; - Type 5: cardiac ischemia that occurs up to 48 after Bypass.Dx: ECG (if above, send immediately for catheterization, without above doing the rest) High-sensitivity troponin and echocardiogram; Immediate Tx: enoxaparin
AMI typically presents as retrosternal pain, which may radiate from the umbilicus to the mandible, as well as to the upper limbs. It may be accompanied by symptoms such as sweating, vomiting, dyspnoea. The approach of these patients should be an ECG in less than 10 min, to assess changes in the ST-T segment, if there is ST elevation, they should be referred for urgent catheterization. Otherwise, cardiac markers (troponin and myoglobin) should be requested, if there is an increase in markers, we consider AMI without ST elevation. If the pain is less than 20 min and there is no evidence of markers, we consider unstable angina. All this is always dependent on the ap.
It presents as a sudden, tightening retrosternal pain, with an intensity usually between 7, 8 out of 10, usually with a few hours of evolution, usually without relieving or worsening factors, associated with sudden dyspnea, sweating and anxiety. In the emergency department, ECG is performed and the patient is medicated with aspirin plus an antiplatelet and anticoagulant. If AMI with supra, perform catheterization.
Retrosternal, oppressive chest pain that relieves with rest and aggravates with exertion. May alleviate with nitrates. ECG changes with or without ST elevation, and signs of myocardial ischemia with elevated cardiac enzymes. There are 5 types of AMI.
Acute Myocardial Infarction is an Acute Myocardial Injury, so there must be an elevation of cardiac biomarkers, more specifically of troponin, which, to be acute, must have a clearance, followed by a descent. In addition, they must have clinical evidence of ischemia, either with ischemic symptoms or with electrocardiographic changes, for example. There are 5 types of AMI: Type 1 when there is an occlusion of the coronary vessel by clot, Type 2 when there is an imbalance between the needs and an O2 supply, Type 3 when there is sudden death from AMI, Type 4 when there is AMI associated with PCI and Type 5 when there is MI associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. The AMI can also be an Acute Coronary Syndrome With Supra ST (there is total occlusion of the vessel) or Without Supra ST (there is no total occlusion of the vessel). Treatment can be fibrinolysis if there is hemodynamic and therapeutic instability.
Clinical Presentation: Retrosternal pain of sudden onset, usually of the anginal type (relieved with rest/nitrates, worsens with physical exercise and is of the constrictive type with irradiation to the ESM, or else to the mandible, for example). MCDT: ECG, Myocardial Necrosis MarkersEpidemiology: Cardiovascular diseases are very prevalent in our society, stroke and AMI being the main causes of mortality and morbidity.
A heart attack results from a miss-match between the needs of the heart muscle and the supply for the bloodstream.
Severe retrosternal pain, burning sensation, which may radiate to the left arm and/or left jaw. It may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms, such as sweating, nausea, vomiting and feeling faint or syncope. When receiving a patient with chest pain, it is important to perform an ECG within 10 minutes to observe the presence of ST-segment elevation in the leads and thus make a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation. If you do not have ST supra, it is necessary to do a serial assay of cardiac damage markers, as for example troponins and myoglobin. In the presence of these high markers, we have a diagnosis of AMI without ST elevation or unstable angina. Treatment requires dual therapeutic administration of anti-aggregation (ticagrelor and aspirin), as well as enoxaparin. If the onset of pain was less than 3 hours, alteplase can be administered, if it is longer than 3 hours, coronary angioplasty can be performed.
AMI - retrosternal tightening chest pain, usually of high intensity, which does not relieve with rest, lasts more than 20 minutes, radiating from the umbilicus to the jaw, including both upper limbs, which may be associated with nausea, weakness, dizziness, paresthesias, malaise; need to perform an ecg in the first 10 minutes of contact with the INEM/hospital, if a heart attack with ST-elevation, immediate catheterization (without waiting for the results of myocardial necrosis markers); if a heart attack without ST-elevation, depending on the patient's risk, catheterization may be performed within the first 2h, 24h or later.
AMI can have several etiologies, the most frequent being atherosclerotic plaque (type I AMI). It may also be due to an O2 demand lower than what is needed, due to anemia, spontaneous coronary dissection (type II AMI). It is characterized by acute chest pain that can radiate to the arms, jaw, intense sweating, fainting or feeling faint, vomiting, and severe malaise. Diagnosis is made from ECG (if ST elevation), if there is no ST elevation, myocardial necrosis markers are requested. The treatment is done by placing a strent or bipass. Chronic treatment is made with AAS and clopidogrel, for example.
Cardiac pathology with podromic symptoms that usually begin days before the event. These include retrosternal pain that can radiate to the shoulders or neck, dyspnea and fatigue. Risk factors: dyslipidemia, smoking, hta, diabetes, uncontrolled diet, family history of heart attack... .
It is caused by myocardial muscle ischemia, due to an occlusion of one or more coronary arteries. It usually presents as severe retrosternal chest pain that may radiate to the upper limbs and neck. On the ECG, it may present an elevation of the T wave, but this change is not necessary. The echocardiogram may show changes in the kinesia of the affected wall. Depending on the type of infarction and the duration of the simt, it may be necessary to carry out catheterization for arterial revascularization.
Acute Myocardial Infarction = Acute Coronary Syndrome Epidemiology: + common in males, from 45 years of age and in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (HTA, DM, Dyslipidemia, Smoking, Obesity) Clinical + common: tightening retrosternal pain, with irradiation for the upper limbs, the jaw and the abdomen (up to the navel), the pain is usually aggravated with exercise. Additionally, it may prove diaphoresis, nausea, pallor, etc. Diagnosis: ECG with ST-supra in at least 2 contiguous leads; elevation of cardiac markers
AMI is the result of rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque, with the formation of a thrombus, which can completely or partially occlude the artery in question, leading to myocardial damage that is no longer suppressed. The main symptoms are oppressive, retrosternal chest pain, which may radiate to the neck, left UL, back, abdomen, jaw and may have associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, diaphoresis, syncope. Elderly people, women and diabetics may have a more atypical apprehension. It is an urgent pathology, which must be identified and treated as soon as possible.
AMI is an ischemic disease that affects the coronary arteries. It happens when there is arterial occlusion (total or partial) which causes a decrease in the supply of oxygen to the myocardium and a missmatch between the supply and the needs of the myocardium. If not corrected in time, it can cause myocardial necrosis which, at this point, is irreversible. AMI causes a characteristic, severe, tight pain in the chest that may radiate from the jaw root to the navel (sensibly). On ECG, it may present with or without ST-segment elevation and cause elevation of myocardial injury markers (especially troponins and CK). Treatment in the acute phase for pain relief is based on opioids and potent vasodilators (usually morphine and nitrates, respectively) using other procedures or drugs, depending on the signs and symptoms. The treatment of AMI is done by cardiac catheterization, usually or another.
There are infarcts with ST elevation and without ST elevation.... Given this diagnosis, it will be important to send the patient for revascularization as soon as possible. After revascularization, the patient will take aspirin for life, b-blocker and then depending on the FRCV may still benefit from IECAS
It can be with ST elevation or without ST elevation. It represents ischemia (usually due to atherosclerotic occlusion) with myocardial necrosis of one or more coronary arteries. The pain is usually very intense, can last for hours, and can radiate to the left arm, jaw, or neck. It is usually described as a "chest tightness". It may be associated with nausea, sweating, pallor and dyspnoea. It is critical that an ECG be performed in less than 10 minutes and that clearance through ICP-P or fibrinolysis (ICP-P is usually preferred, if possible). Markers of myocardial necrosis are also requested, the best being Tropinin
CV risk factors: DM, AHT, Obesity, Smoking, Age (the main one!), alcohol consumption, kidney failure, sedentary lifestyle. Incidence increases with age and with the presence of risk factors. Treatment: stent placement Diagnosis: achievement 12-lead ECG with ST elevation in more than 2 contiguous leads.Clinic: Retrosternal pain that may radiate to the mandible and left arm, in tightness/stabbing associated with nausea, hypersweating, and syncope, lasting for more than 20 min.
