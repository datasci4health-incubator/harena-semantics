It has been suggested that maintaining cardiac output (CO) above normal in patients with septic shock should increase oxygen delivery (D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>) and oxygen consumption (V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>), decrease any oxygen debt present, and potentially improve survival. However, the tissue extraction of needed oxygen is maintained even at very low levels of D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>increases with increasing D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>only up to a point. Thereafter, subsequent increases in D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>do not result in any further increase in V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>(Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>). Attempts to increase the D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>beyond this point are more likely to be harmful because the methods used (e.g. inotropes) have potential harmful effects (such as increased oxygen demand in tissues, tachyarrhythmias, worsening distribution of blood flow in tissues, and myocardial ischemia).', 'What is the rationale for maintaining high cardiac output?: The rationale for maintaining high CO comes from studies that found higher levels of cardiac index (CI), D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>, and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>in patients with septic shock who survived than in those who died [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>].

Even assuming that survivors do have higher levels of CI, D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>, and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>than do nonsurvivors, the question is whether the higher levels of CI, D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>, and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>actually improve survival or are just markers for patients who are more likely to survive.', 'Does oxygen consumption increase with increasing oxygen delivery?: In the initial studies showing that an increase in D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>is associated with an increase in V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>(suggesting that a tissue oxygen debt exists), both D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>were calculated using the Fick principle for CO [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. However, if a measured variable is used to determine two parameters, errors in measurement may \\'couple\\' the calculations (i.e. although there may appear to be a relationship between the variables, one may not exist at all) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Hemoglobin, CO, arterial oxygen saturation, and arterial oxygen tension are the shared variables used in calculating both D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>. To avoid mathematical coupling, it has been suggested that V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>be calculated by a different method from that used for D<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>. Four subsequent studies in septic patients using independent methods to calculate the parameters found no correlation between D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], although one study did show a correlation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Thus, there is controversy regarding whether maintaining a high CO will result in the desired increase in V<sc>O</sc><sub>2</sub>.', 'Should an increase in oxygen delivery be the target for treatment?: The studies advocating treatment to achieve supranormal cardiorespiratory values have generally used increased D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>as the goal of therapy. However, the calculated D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>only reflects the amount of oxygen \\'dispatched\\' from the ventricle into the aorta, rather than the actual delivery of oxygen to the respiring tissues.

Only one study found a survival benefit, but only in the subgroup of patients between the ages of 50 and 75 years [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]; overall mortality data were not given in the report.', 'Do septic patients have higher critical oxygen delivery?: Another reason for maintaining higher CO and D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>offered by proponents of this strategy is that patients with sepsis may have a higher critical D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>level (i.e. the level of D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>below which metabolism changes from aerobic to anaerobic). However, Ronco and coworkers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] measured D<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>(using the Fick equation) and V<sc>O</sc><sub>2 </sub>(by indirect calorimetry) in nine septic and nine nonseptic critically ill patients.

TNF and IL-1β both activate endothelial cells, attracting circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to the site. They also enter the circulation, causing fever and other systemic symptoms. IL-6 enhances the liver’s production of the so-called acute phase reactants, including CRP, and also stimulates a shift in the production of cells in the bone marrow so that more PMNs are produced. Therefore, these three cytokines are essentially responsible for the features of SIRS and could be potentially useful as biomarkers of sepsis (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f2\">Figure 2</xref>).<fig xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" fig-type=\"figure\" id=\"f2\" orientation=\"portrait\" position=\"float\"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Sepsis begins with either infection or tissue injury.

Activation of the complement cascade also produces pro-inflammatory peptides such as C5a, a cleavage product of complement protein 5. There is considerable evidence that complement has a role in promoting the inflammatory state in sepsis, and the focus has been on C5a as a potentially useful biomarker. In the CLP mouse model of sepsis, all three complement pathways (classical, lectin and alternative) are activated with downstream elevations in the level of C5a<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b56\">56</xref>.

Depending on the level on inflammation, this stimulation may also cause PMN precursors to leave the bone marrow before they have completely matured. Either an increase in the total number of circulating PMNs or an increase in the percentage of immature forms is one of the criteria for SIRS. Circulating PMNs in patients with sepsis are also already activated by cytokines, and this activation results in changes in their appearance. Toxic granulations represent increased concentrations of antimicrobial compounds in the primary granules, and Döhle bodies are aggregates of endoplasmic reticulum; both are markers of PMN activation in bacterial infection<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b61\">61</xref>. Activation of PMNs may be detected even earlier by analyzing the levels of certain cell differentiation molecules on the PMN cell surface, using quantitative flow cytometry (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"f3\">Figure 3</xref>).

Briefly, the methodology used by these reports is primarily based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for principal hospital discharge diagnosis. The databases are linked with state and national population data from the US Census for the same year to generate population-based incidence rates. In order to identify cases of severe sepsis, the authors selected all cases with ICD-9 for bacterial or fungal infection and a diagnosis of acute organ dysfunction. Then, the authors compared those patients selected by ICD-9 with the standard clinical criteria for the definitions of severe sepsis<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b9-cln63_1p0109\">9</xref> and sepsis.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13-cln63_1p0109\">13</xref> Martin et al.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13-cln63_1p0109\">13</xref> estimated the incidence of sepsis in the US as 240 cases per 100,000 people, and Angus et al.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b9-cln63_1p0109\">9</xref> reported 300 cases of severe sepsis per 100,000 people. The inicidence was projected to increase by 1.5% per annum. The mortality rate reported in these studies was also similar, ranging from 17.9% for sepsis<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b13-cln63_1p0109\">13</xref> to 28.6% for severe sepsis.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b9-cln63_1p0109\">9</xref> These numbers translate into approximately 750,000 new episodes of severe sepsis, with an annual mortality rate of 220,000 (29%) in the US.

Determining the structural components of the bacteria that are responsible for initiating the septic process has been important, not only in understanding the underlying mechanisms, but also in identifying potential therapeutic targets. These bacterial motifs, which are recognized by the innate immune system, have been called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), although it might be more accurate to call them microorganism-associated molecular patterns as it is by no means clear how the host distinguishes between signals from pathogens and commensals.<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b18-cln63_1p0109\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"b19-cln63_1p0109\">19</xref> In Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS; known also as endotoxin) plays a dominant role. LPS is embedded in the outer membrane, and the lipid A portion of the molecule anchors LPS in the bacterial cell wall. Conformational changes of LPS seem to correlate with its ability to activate host cell membranes. There is no endotoxin in Gram-positive bacteria, but an important feature is the production of potent exotoxins. These Gram-positive exotoxins are of great interest because they exhibit the properties of superantigens, that is, they are able to bind promiscuously to major histocompatibility complex class II and a restricted repertoire of T-lymphocyte receptor (TCR) Vb domains. In so doing, they cause massive T-cell activation and release of pro-inflammatory lymphokines. The best known examples are toxic shock syndrome caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)-producing strains of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and the pyrogenic exotoxins from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes.</italic> Peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from the gram-positive cell walls can bind to cell-surface receptors and are pro-inflammatory, although they are much less active on a weight-for-weight basis than LPS.

A group of international critical care and infectious disease clinicians, experts in the diagnosis and management of infection and sepsis who represent 11 organizations, came together to develop guidelines that the bedside clinician could use to improve outcome in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Sepsis can evolve to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), whose severity accounts for a high mortality rate. During sepsis, liver dysfunction is one of the MODS components and usually is associated with a poor prognosis but its precise incidence remains unclear. Whereas the liver plays a pivotal role in regulating a wide range of key metabolic, homeostatic, and host-defense activities, liver dysfunction is commonly viewed only as a consequence of shock and initial tissue hypoperfusion. In fact, the injured liver may be considered one of the main actors in the genesis and amplification of multiple organ failure. However, the lack of reliable diagnostic tools does not allow detection of early liver dysfunction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. This concise overview aims to describe the epidemiology and prognostic value of liver dysfunction during sepsis, then to review the pathophysiological aspects and clinical features of liver dysfunction, and finally to propose a main therapeutic axis and perspectives on specific treatment.', 'Septic liver dysfunction: incidence and definitions and impact on mortality: The precise incidence of sepsis liver dysfunction remains difficult to establish because of the lack of a precise and consensus definition and the various observation times. Sands and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>] defined liver failure as a combination of a total bilirubin level of greater than 2 mg/dL (&gt; 34 μmol/L) and either an alkaline phosphatase or serum aminotransferase level of greater than twice the normal value. In a cohort of 1,342 episodes of sepsis syndrome, liver failure was present in 12% within 28 days of the onset of disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Conversely, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, Angus and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] identified 192,980 cases of severe sepsis in seven states in the US and observed hepatic failure in only 1.3%. However, this small incidence is explained by a strongly restrictive definition of liver dysfunction, including only acute and subacute necrosis of the liver and hepatic infarction. In a more recent clinical trial involving 312 patients in septic shock, acute liver failure was reported in 20% during the 72-hour period of the study treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. This acute liver failure was defined by at least two of the following items: (a) bilirubin of greater than 2.5 mg/dL (&gt; 43 μmol/L), (b) serum alanine transaminase concentration of more than twice the upper limit, and (c) prothrombin time of greater than 1.5 times the control value or an international normalized ratio of greater than 1.5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. The 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference recommended the use of scoring systems, such as the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the MODS score, or the Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. All of these scores aim to quantify the degree of organ(s) dysfunction(s) over the course of sepsis and use bilirubin to assess and define liver dysfunction in addition to prothrombin time for the LODS score. In this conference, sepsis liver dysfunction was defined as a plasma total bilirubin of greater than 4 mg/dL (&gt; 70 μmol/L) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], but, interestingly, this cutoff value was not proposed by any of the cited scoring systems. Except for the early phase of severe sepsis/septic shock in which an acute elevation of serum aminotransferase levels (20-fold the upper limit of normal) permits the diagnosis of hypoxic hepatitis (HH) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], serum bilirubin could be assumed to be the most widely used and proposed biomarker to diagnose hepatic dysfunction/failure during sepsis. Thus, using the SOFA score, the French EPISEPSIS (EPIdemiology of SEPSIS) study group reported incidences of liver dysfunction (hepatic score of greater than 0) and liver failure (hepatic score of 3 or 4) of 46.6% and 6.3%, respectively, in 541 patients with severe sepsis during the first 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. In the same population and with the same score, the PROWESS (Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis) trial reported incidences of liver dysfunction (hepatic score of 1 or 2) and liver failure (hepatic score of 3 or 4) of 35.6% and 2.75%, respectively [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>].', 'Pathophysiological aspects: The pathophysiological aspects of liver dysfunction are complex and not yet well understood. Basically, the liver has a role in endotoxin and bacteria scavenging, detoxification, and synthesizing proteins for metabolic, immune, and coagulation functions. Several cells are involved in these processes: hepatocytes (HCs), Küpffer cells (KCs), and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs). To ensure these functions, liver perfusion, which represents 25% of the cardiac output, is accomplished mainly by portal venous blood flow. This flow is regulated by the hepatic arterial buffer response, which aims to compensate any reduction in portal blood flow [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>].', 'Cellular and molecular effects: Except for HH, several experimental data argue for an early and insidious liver dysfunction during the initial phase of sepsis. To date, however, this early liver dysfunction has not been easily detectable in clinical practice.', 'Clinical events: At the bedside, liver dysfunction is non-univocal, and two schematic clinical features may be observed: HH mainly as a result of an extrahepatic vascular event and jaundice or sepsis-induced cholestasis as the consequence of an insidious and slow intrahepatic injury. Despite sharing some similarities, these features are quite different.', 'Hypoxic hepatitis: HH is defined according to three criteria [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]: (a) a clinical setting of cardiac, circulatory, or respiratory failure; (b) a dramatic and transient increase in serum aminotransferase activity (at least 20-fold higher than the upper limit of normal); and (c) the exclusion of other putative causes of liver cell necrosis. Septic shock with HH represents up to 32% of all HH cases in ICU patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] and can lead to fulminant hepatic failure. In cardiogenic shock, HH is secondary to decreased cardiac output and oxygen delivery. However, in septic shock, splanchnic blood flow and cardiac output are increased but not sufficient to counterbalance the high demands for oxygen and the inability of liver cells to extract oxygen [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>]. Moreover, vascular mechanisms of defense against portal blood flow reduction are altered, especially the hepatic arterial buffer response [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Compromised liver hemodynamics, however, do not always lead to HH. Endotoxins and pro-inflammatory mediators could have an important role in potentiating HH development. Although the mechanisms are not fully understood, HH could result from the reoxygenation phase caused by the ischemia/reperfusion phenomenon, including oxidant stress, early activation of KCs, and secondary recruitment and activation of systemic neutrophils [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>]. The enzymatic pattern of HH starts with sharp but unsustained increases in ASAT, ALAT, and LDH levels 24 hours after the initiation of shock; decreasing levels are observed 2 or 3 days later, and normal levels are reached in approximately 15 days. The other hallmark of HH is an early and dramatic drop in prothrombin levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>], which is responsible for hemorrhagic syndrome. A serum creatinine level of greater than 20 mg/L (&gt; 177 μmol/L) was observed in 65% of HH but probably reflects the renal impairment caused by the hemodynamic failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. In addition, a delayed elevation of bilirubin in HH is described but, in most cases, without visible jaundice.', 'Jaundice or sepsis-induced cholestasis: Clinical jaundice is usually associated with severe infections such as pneumonia, Gram-negative bacterial sepsis, or septic shock [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. An observational study conducted in 283 critically ill patients revealed sepsis as one of the most important promoters of hyperbilirubinemia (&gt; 2 mg/dL or 34 μmol/L) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. Commonly during sepsis, increased bilirubin levels are a late event in the course of multiorgan dysfunction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>]. In a large cohort of ICU patients, 11% had an \\'early\\' hepatic dysfunction defined as a bilirubin concentration of greater than 2 mg/dL (&gt; 34 μmol/L) within 48 hours of admission [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. Liver histological studies in patients with bacteremic jaundiced showed a predomin ant intrahepatic cholestasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>]. Among their various functions, bile and bile acids are involved mainly in gut trophicity and gut barrier integrity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>]. Their transport and excretion into the canalicular duct are highly dependent on energy and oxygen. HCs are dual-polarity cells that have both basolateral and canalicular membranes. Bile formation is an active osmotic process that involves the crossing of organic and inorganic molecules through the canalicular membrane followed by passive movement of water. Bile formation also requires the correct functioning of integral membrane proteins (that is, an intact cytoskeleton, tight junctions, and intracellular signal transduction) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>]. First, unconjugated bilirubin uptake is promoted at the basolateral membrane and conjugated bilirubin transported across the canalicular membrane by an energy-dependent multidrug-resistant protein 2 (MRP2) pump [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1a</xref>). Basolateral membranes facilitate bile acid transport into HCs: unconjugated bile acids are taken up by members of the solute carrier organic anion transporter family (SLC21), formerly known as organic anion-trans porting polypeptides (OATPs), and conjugated bile acids are transported into HCs mainly by the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is helped by an AT P-dependent Na/K/ATPase pump. Efflux systems for bile acids also exist at basolateral poles. At the canalicular membrane, bile acids are excreted mainly by an ATP-dependent bile salt export pump (BSEP) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>]. Furthermore, a bile acid-independent bile flow (BAIBF) participates in bile flow generation and involves the active secretion of inorganic electrolytes, such as bicarbonate. During sepsis, most of these steps can be impaired because of a lack of energy such as hypoxia or hypoperfusion or both [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>], and BSEP is a major bile flow-limiting factor at the canalicular level (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1b</xref>). Endotoxins or pro-inflammatory cytokines cause direct impairment of bile flow through alterations of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression of bile acid transporters, resulting in the downregulation of transporter proteins [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>]. Cytokines promote oxidant stress that results in the inhibition of cAMP-dependent transport function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>] and BAIBF. Finally, endotoxins severely alter the cytoskeletal architecture of HCs contributing to the disturbance of bile flow (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1b</xref>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>]. All of these alterations contribute to hyperbilirubinemia associated with an intrahepatic cholestasis, the severity of which likely depends on the intensity of the impaired steps in bile formation. The reduction of bile flow or the absence of intraluminal bile can lead to intestinal mucosal atrophy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] and then deprives the gut of its bacteriostatic neutralizing effects and promotes an increase of endotoxin blood levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>]. This endotoxin release participates in direct bile flow reduction and thus might enter the liver in a vicious circle promoting MODS.', 'Therapeutic considerations: No specific therapeutics for liver sepsis dysfunction/failure are currently available. Nevertheless, a set of recommendations could be given from the perspective of liver dysfunction/failure. Thus, sepsis liver management relies first on early goal-directed resuscitation as recommended (that is, early antibiotic therapy and infection source control, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support to restore perfusion in the liver and other organs as well as support for the associated organ failure) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>]. Indeed, an appropriate hemodynamic restoration permits the restoration of liver perfusion and is an essential step in avoiding liver dysfunction. Interestingly, experimental data suggest that catecholamines could have an effect in the inflammatory response and participate in hepatic dysfunction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. Corticosteroid use in septic shock is still debated, but with respect to the liver, experimental data suggest that they may have an immunomodulation effect on sepsis-induced cholestasis through the induction of hepatobiliary transporters and restoration of bile transport [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Moreover, in the CORTICUS (Corticosteroid Therapy of Septic Shock) study, hydrocortisonetreated patients demonstrated a faster improvement in liver failure (SOFA hepatic score of 3 or 4) during the first week (<italic>P </italic>&lt; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. However, at present, the use of corticosteroids cannot be recommended for the treatment of sepsis-induced hepatic dysfunction.', 'Conclusions: Sepsis-induced liver dysfunction is a frequent event and is strongly associated with mortality. During the past few decades, its pathophysiology, including hypoxic and cholestasis aspects, has been better understood. However, the tools to diagnose liver dysfunction earlier and more accurately remain limited. At this time, the treatment of liver dysfunction is included only in the general therapeutic steps on sepsis syndrome management. An earlier and better identification of patients with liver dysfunction is warranted and may be the way to evaluate new therapeutic strategies and further improve the prognosis of sepsis.', 'Abbreviations: ALAT: alanine aminotransferase; ASAT: aspartate aminotransferase; BAIBF: bile acid-independent bile flow; BSEP: bile salt export pump; EN: enteral nutrition; EPISEPSIS: EPIdemiology of SEPSIS; HC: hepatocyte; HH: hypoxic hepatitis; ICD-9-CM: International Classification of Diseases: Ninth Revision: Clinical Modification; ICG: indocyanine green; ICU: intensive care unit; IFN-<italic>γ</italic>: interferongamma; IL: interleukin; KC: Küpffer cell; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; LODS: logistic organ dysfunction score; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MODS: multiple organ dysfunction syndrome; NO: nitric oxide; PDR<sub>ICG</sub>: plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green; PROWESS: Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis; SEC: sinusoidal endothelial cell; SIRS: systemic inflamatory response syndrome; SOFA: sepsis-related organ failure assessment; TNF-<italic>α</italic>: tumor necrosis factor-alpha.', 'Competing interests: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'], '_version_': 1682300181395013635}\n",

Multiple factors, including prematurity, invasive life-saving medical interventions, and immaturity of the innate immune system, put these infants at greater risk of developing infection. Although advanced neonatal care enables us to save even the most preterm neonates, the very interventions sustaining those who are hospitalized concurrently expose them to serious infections due to common nosocomial pathogens, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci bacteria (CoNS). Moreover, the health burden from infection in these infants remains unacceptably high despite continuing efforts. In this paper, we review the epidemiology, immunological risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes of neonatal infection due to the predominant neonatal pathogen CoNS.'], 'body': ['1. Epidemiology of Neonatal Sepsis: Neonatal sepsis is defined as infection in the first 28 days of life, or up to 4 weeks after the expected due date for preterm infants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Epidemiologists defined two types of infections in neonates: early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS), which manifests in the first 72 hours of life (up to 7 days) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS), whose incidence peaks in the 2nd to 3rd week of postnatal life [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. The mortality from neonatal sepsis has dramatically decreased over the last century, because of medical advances. In the preantibiotic era (&lt;1940), the case fatality rate of neonatal sepsis was extremely high, exceeding 80% [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>]. By the late 1960s, the introduction of antibiotics and the development of modern perinatal care had lowered this case fatality rate to less than 20% overall [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>]. The composition of pathogens causing neonatal sepsis has also changed dramatically over the last century [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">6</xref>]. In the early 1930s, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and group A streptococci were responsible for almost half of the cases of LONS [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">3</xref>]. By the 1960s, gram-negative bacilli had become major pathogens [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">3</xref>], along with the emergence of group B streptococci (GBS) as a predominant cause of EONS [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>]. In North America, gram-positive organisms account for the majority of neonatal sepsis cases (up to 70%). Sepsis due to gram-negative organisms (~15 to 20%) and fungi (~10%) is less common, and polymicrobial bloodstream infections contribute to less than 15% of cases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">8</xref>]. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are the major pathogen involved in LONS, particularly in infants born at a lower gestational age. According to more recent data from the National Institutes of Child Health and Development (NICHD), infection-related mortality in very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) averages 10% [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">7</xref>] but can reach 40% depending on the pathogen involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">11</xref>]. Preterm neonates have a high risk of developing neonatal infections, resulting in high mortality and serious long-term morbidities [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">12</xref>]. In North America, it is estimated that each episode of sepsis prolongs the duration of a neonate\\'s hospital stay by about 2 weeks, resulting in an incremental cost of USD$25,000 per episode [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">13</xref>]. In a more recent study, authors estimated that nosocomial bloodstream infections increase the neonatal hospitalization cost for VLBW infants in the lowest birth weight group (401–750 grams) by 26%, and that of the highest birth weight group (1251–1500 grams) by 80% [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">14</xref>]. This study also estimated that the duration of hospital stay increased by four to seven days in all VLBW categories with a nosocomial bloodstream infection [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">14</xref>]. ', '2. Pathogenesis: Within the first week of life, neonates become rapidly colonized by microorganisms originating from the environment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">19</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">22</xref>]. During this period, the risk of CoNS infection increases substantially with the use of central venous catheters (CVC), mechanical ventilation, and parenteral nutrition, and with exposure to other invasive skin- or mucosa-breaching procedures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">23</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">28</xref>]. CoNS are common inhabitants of the skin and mucous membranes; although a small proportion of neonates acquire CoNS by vertical transmission, acquisition primarily occurs horizontally [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">29</xref>]. Consequently, infants admitted to a hospital obtain most of their microorganisms from the hospital environment, their parents, and staff [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">31</xref>]. Transmission via the hands of hospital staff can lead to endemic strains circulating for extended periods [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">32</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">35</xref>]. Because CoNS is a ubiquitous skin commensal, authors have assumed that colonizations of the skin and of indwelling catheters are important sources of sepsis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">34</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">36</xref>]. However, recent studies suggest that epithelial loci other than the skin, such as the nares, may be important access points of infection [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">34</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">36</xref>]. Antibiotic resistance in skin-residing strains has been found to be low at birth but to increase rapidly during the first week of hospitalization [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">37</xref>]. Selective pressure as a result of perinatal antibiotic exposure, therefore, is an additional major factor influencing the spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of microorganisms isolated from neonates.', '3. Diagnosis: Neonatal sepsis is clinically diagnosed by a combination of clinical signs, nonspecific laboratory tests and microbiologically confirmed by detection of bacteria in blood by culture. Clinical signs of sepsis in neonates are usually nonspecific and often inconspicuous. They include the presence of fever or hypothermia (in the preterm neonate, this is more commonly seen as a general disturbance in thermoregulation); lethargy; poor feeding; respiratory distress or apnea; pallor; jaundice; tachycardia or bradycardia; hypotension; disturbances in gastrointestinal function (diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal distention, and ileus); and thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B102\">99</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B103\">100</xref>]. With CoNS, such clinical signs are often more subtle because of the low virulence of these organisms. However more serious, often persistent illness due to more virulent strains can occur in a considerable minority of cases, in association with severe thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B104\">101</xref>].

', '5. Long-Term Sequelae: Multiple studies show that neonatal sepsis has major long-term neurodevelopmental consequences in survivors, particularly in preterm infants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B156\">153</xref>]. In modern intensive care, about half of extremely preterm neonates born at 24 weeks\\' gestation and the majority of neonates over 25 weeks\\' gestation generally survive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B157\">154</xref>]. The risk of such morbidity in extremely premature neonates is inversely proportional to their gestational age [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B158\">155</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B161\">158</xref>]. In VLBW infants, neonatal sepsis dramatically increases the long-term risk of motor, cognitive, neurosensory and visual impairments [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B160\">157</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B162\">159</xref>]. The risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in VLBW neonates with sepsis is further increased with other comorbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B160\">157</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B163\">160</xref>]. This increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in preterm infants with sepsis has several reasons, including a high risk of meningitis; heightened adverse effect of sepsis-associated cardiovascular instability during a vulnerable period for the developing brain; and increased neurotoxic effects of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B156\">153</xref>]. Surprisingly, the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome in VLBW infants surviving from neonatal sepsis does not appear to depend on the infecting organism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B160\">157</xref>], although in some studies extremely premature infants who experienced sepsis had a greater risk of a hearing impairment when the infection involved gram-negative, fungal, or combined infections [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B160\">157</xref>]. ', '6. Future Therapies: Despite limited natural antibody immune protection in preterm neonates, meta-analyses of intravenous immunoglobulin administration have so far failed to demonstrate sufficient therapeutic benefits [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B164\">161</xref>–<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B166\">163</xref>]. Other immunomodulatory therapies designed to improve neonatal immune deficits, such as granulocyte transfusions, or administration of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor which increases neutrophils and enhances their antimicrobial activity, have also not yet translated into concrete benefits in clinical trials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B164\">161</xref>]. Finally, lactoferrin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein that sequesters iron, may be useful in reducing the incidence of late-onset sepsis in low-birth-weight neonates [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B167\">164</xref>]. The future of antistaphylococcal immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis requires more research. This may require a combined use of adjunctive immunomodulatory treatments to enhance the innate immune system of neonates while disabling virulence factors that enable resistance to conventional antibiotic treatment of CoNS. ', '7. Conclusion: The 20th century saw CoNS emerge as the foremost pathogen of neonatal sepsis in developed countries. VLBW neonates contribute disproportionately to CoNS-related morbidity and mortality, in stark contrast to their full-term counterparts who usually suffer milder symptoms. Several reasons make prematurity the single most important factor for neonatal sepsis: innate immunological deficiencies; prolonged stays in the NICU; and, notably, the higher use of indispensable but invasive medical interventions in these developmentally immature neonates. Advances in medical technology have dramatically increased the survival rate of premature neonates. This corresponds to a growing burden of both short- and long-term problems associated with neonatal sepsis. Effective prophylactic measures, prompt and accurate diagnoses, and subsequent administration of targeted therapy are vital to curb the excessive burden of disease that CoNS infection imposes upon this highly vulnerable age group.'], 'id': 'cff1b8ee-d77e-4436-8de8-8d48286b56a0', '_version_': 1682300181735800832}\n",

We have termed this condition microcirculatory and mitochondrial distress syndrome (MMDS). Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging allowed the first clinical observation of the microcirculation in human internal organs, and has identified the pivotal role of microcirculatory abnormalities in defining the severity of sepsis, a condition not revealed by systemic hemodynamic or oxygen-derived variables. Recently, sublingual sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging has been introduced, allowing observation of the microcirculation in even greater detail. Microcirculatory recruitment is needed to ensure adequate microcirculatory perfusion and the oxygenation of tissue cells that follows. In sepsis, where inflammation-induced autoregulatory dysfunction persists and oxygen need is not matched by supply, the microcirculation can be recruited by reducing pathological shunting, promoting microcirculatory perfusion, supporting pump function, and controlling hemorheology and coagulation. Resuscitation following MMDS must include focused recruitment of hypoxic-shunted microcirculatory units and/or resuscitation of the mitochondria. A combination of agents is required for successful rescue of the microcirculation. Single compounds such as activated protein C, which acts on multiple pathways, can be expected to be beneficial in rescuing the microcirculation in sepsis.'], 'body': ['Introduction: The recent development of new medical imaging techniques, together with data from clinical investigations, has helped to identify the microcirculation as playing a key role in sepsis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. The array of pathogenic factors that occur in sepsis affects almost every cellular component of the microcirculation, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and tissue cells. If not corrected directly, a poorly functioning microvasculature can lead to respiratory distress in tissue cells further fuelling microcirculatory dysfunction in a cascade of pathogenic mechanisms leading to organ failure (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>). Sakr and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>] showed that microcirculatory distress not corrected for 24 hours was the single independent factor predicting patient outcome. The central role of the microcirculation in providing oxygen to the tissue cells makes it of prime importance in determining organ function. Microcirculatory dysfunction persisting for extended periods of time can act as a motor driving the pathogenic effects of sepsis leading to organ failure in much the same way as the gut was considered to be the motor of multiorgan failure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>].', 'The microcirculation: Microcirculatory function is the main prerequisite for adequate tissue oxygenation and thus organ function. Its purpose is to transport oxygen and nutrients to tissue cells, ensure adequate immunological function and, in disease, to deliver therapeutic drugs to target cells. The microcirculation consists of the smallest blood vessels (<100 μm diameter) where oxygen release to the tissues takes place, and consists of arterioles, capillaries, and venules. The main cell types comprising the microcirculation are the endothelial cells lining the inside of the microvessels, smooth muscle cells (mostly in arterioles), red blood cells, leukocytes, and plasma components in blood. The structure and function of the microcirculation is highly heterogeneous in different organ systems. In general, driving pressure, arteriolar tone, hemorheology, and capillary patency are the main determinants of capillary blood flow.', 'Rescuing the microcirculation: The presence of microcirculatory distress, despite resuscitation based on hemodynamic and oxygen-derived endpoints, strongly suggests that microcirculatory failure is a key factor in the raised lactate levels, disturbed acid–base balance, and high gastric and/or oral CO<sub>2 </sub>levels sometimes seen under such conditions. Microcirculatory failure can occur in the presence of normal or supranormal systemic hemodynamic- and oxygen-derived variables, with microcirculatory distress being masked from the systemic circulation by shunting pathways [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. Thus, monitoring techniques are required to verify that recruitment strategies for the microcirculation are indeed effective.', 'Conclusion: In this review, we discuss the role of microcirculatory dysfunction in the development and treatment of the circulatory distributive defect associated with sepsis leading to organ failure. Conventional systemic hemodynamic- and oxygen-derived variables fail to detect such microcirculatory dysfunction and its response to the therapy. If left uncorrected, microcirculatory dysfunction can fuel cellular distress of the parenchymal cells and lead to organ dysfunction. From this perspective the microcirculation can indeed be regarded as the motor of sepsis.
